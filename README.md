# Addressing SOL Pass Rates in Virginia

This project explores SOL (Standards of Learning) pass rates in Virginia using machine learning techniques such as regression and clustering. It includes an IPython notebook file and a final report prepared for a machine learning class at college.

## Overview

The analysis aims to understand and predict SOL pass rates based on various factors using machine learning models.

## Files

- **ML4VA_Final_Report___HoosML.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis.
- **ML4VA_HoosML.pdf**: Final report summarizing the findings and methodologies used.
